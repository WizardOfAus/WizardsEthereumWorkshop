### 2 Basics

**Cryptoeconomics** is the use of incentives and cryptography to design new kinds of systems, applications, and networks. Cryptoeconomics shares an interlap with mechanism design (aka reverse game theory). Mechanism design starts with a desired outcome and then work backwards to design a game that, if players pursue their own self interest, will produce the outcome we want.

Cryptoeconomics is what distinguishes blockchains with a coin and what makes them different from other technologies. This can be seen in the case of Bitcoin whose design relies on economic incentives and penalties. Economic rewards for miners to contribute blocks, economic costs/penalties in undermining the system ([cost of 51% attack](https://gobitcoin.io/tools/cost-51-attack/ "hardware and mining costs")) and cryptography protocols to secure the system.

According to Vlad Zamfir, "Cryptoeconomics is the application of incentive mechanism design to information security problems".

### 3 Mechanism Design

Mechanism Design vs. Game Theory

• **Game Theory**: What is the outcome of strategic interaction between individuals in a given game, i.e., economic environment/institution?

• **Mechanism Design**: How do we design the game, i.e., economic environment/institution to obtain a certain outcome?
